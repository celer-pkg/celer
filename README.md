# Celer overview [🌍中文](./docs/zh-CH/README.md)

&emsp;&emsp;Celer is a very lightweight C/C++ package manager written in Go. The name "Celer" is inspired by the vision of being C/C++'s accelerator. Celer is explicitly positioned as a non-intrusive CMake assistant for any CMake projects. It is designed to make it easy for developers to manage and compile third-party libraries with only TOML files.

# The background of Celer

&emsp;&emsp;CMake has become the mainstream build system for compiling C/C++ projects，but it focuses on finding dependencies rather than managing them. Many tasks like fetching source code, handling dependencies between libraries, and setting up cross-compilation still require additional work.  
&emsp;&emsp;This is why we created Celer. It automatically generates a `toolchain_file.cmake` that configures all necessary build tools and library paths, isolating them from system libraries. All preparation work is done before this file is generated.  
&emsp;&emsp;As shown in the diagram, Celer remains decoupled from project development - it simply generates the platform-specific `toolchain_file.cmake` that serves as the bridge to your project.

# Key features

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Configurable cross-compilation platforms** | There are many chip platforms for C/C++ development, and they depend on specific toolchains and corresponding configurations. Celer provides a very friendly configuration entry. |
| **Customizable project configuration** | Supports managing global configurations for different projects, such as: dependency library lists, environment variables, macro definitions, and even global CMake variables, etc. It also supports customizing the compilation process of third-party libraries at the project level, while supporting hosting libraries within each project itself. |
| **Hosting libraries with common build tools** | Support for libraries with build tools such as: **cmake**, **makefiles**, **meson**, **b2**, etc. |
| **Generate CMake configs** | For third-party libraries that do not use CMake as the build tool, corresponding **cmake config** files can be automatically generated. |
| **Precise compilation cache management** | Celer supports precise management of compilation artifacts through shared folders on the local network, which can avoid redundant compilation and improve development efficiency. Additionally, Celer supports obtaining compilation artifacts of libraries without source code, which is very useful for some private libraries. |
| **DEV mode** | `toolchain_file.cmake` can be generated by the `celer deploy` command, which can be used directly for project development. Afterward, you can choose any IDE to develop your project. |
| **CI/CD mode** | You can configure your project in conf/project for integration with CI/CD. |
