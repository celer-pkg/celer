# Celer overview [üåç‰∏≠Êñá](../zh-CH/README.md)

&emsp;&emsp;Celer is a very lightweight C/C++ package manager written in Go. The name "Celer" is inspired by the vision of being C/C++'s accelerator. Celer is explicitly positioned as a non-intrusive CMake assistant for any CMake projects. It is designed to make it easy for developers to manage and compile third-party libraries with only TOML files.

# The background of Celer

&emsp;&emsp;CMake has become the mainstream build system for compiling C/C++ projects, particularly for cross-compiling. While CMake excels at managing the build process‚Äîincluding configuration, compilation, and installation‚Äîit primarily focuses on locating dependencies (via **find_package**) rather than handling higher-level package management tasks. In real-world development, many additional tedious tasks fall outside CMake's responsibilities, such as: **clone repos and setup build tools**, **organize dependencies between third-party libraries**, **setup cross-compilation environment**, etc.  
&emsp;&emsp;Celer's core functionality dynamically generates a `toolchain_file.cmake`, configuring the required build tools with relative paths and specifying library search paths to prevent system libraries from being detected. This means that all the work required is handled by Celer before generating the `toolchain_file.cmake`, this is one of the [**REASONS**](./why_reinvent_celer.md) why Celer was reinvented, rather than relying on other C/C++ package managers.

# Key features

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Download/configure build tools** | Automatically download and configure tools based on the selected platform and target libraries. |
| **Host libraries compiled by various build tools** | Support building and hosting libraries that based on **cmake**, **makefiles**, **meson**, etc. |
| **Generate CMake configs** | Celer can generate CMake configs for none-CMake-based project. |
| **Build artifacts cache managerment** | Celer supports precise build artifact management with a shared folder on the local network.This can avoid redundant compilation and improve development efficiency. Furthermore, Celer supports retrieving the artifact of a library without source code. This is quite usefull for some private libraries. |
| **Projects management and customization of third-party Libraries** | Celer supports multi-project management, allowing project-specific customization of third-party libraries, including version and compilation options. It also enables the management of internal libraries within each project's folder. |
| **Quick deployment** | Celer supports quick deployment with a single command and automatically handle the compilation and installation of all dependencies |
| **DEV mode** | `toolchain_file.cmake` can be generated by `celer deploy` command, it can be used directly in project development, then you can choose any IDE to develop your project.|
| **CI/CD mode** | You can configure your project into **conf/project** to integrate with CI/CD.|
