## ✨ Why Celer?

Celer is the C/C++ accelerator that solves real-world dependency management challenges:

- 🎯 **Zero Project Intrusion** - Just one `toolchain_file.cmake`, no code changes needed
- 🚀 **True Cross-Compilation** - Platform-aware dependency management with pre-configured toolchains
- 📦 **Package Caching** - Hash-based package artifact caching saves hours of build time
- 🔧 **Multi-Build System** - Native support for CMake, Make, Meson, B2, QMake, GYP
- 🏢 **Enterprise Ready** - Project-level configurations prevent dependency version conflicts
- 🔗 **Non-Intrusive Design** - Portable `toolchain_file.cmake` works standalone after generation

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install Celer (or download pre-built package from releases)
git clone https://github.com/celer-pkg/celer.git
cd celer && go build

# 2. Initialize with configuration repository
celer init --url=https://github.com/celer-pkg/test-conf.git

# 3. Configure your platform and project
celer configure --platform=x86_64-linux-ubuntu-22.04-gcc-11.5.0
celer configure --project=my_project

# 4. Deploy and generate toolchain file
celer deploy

# 5. Use in your CMake project
cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/path/to/workspace/toolchain_file.cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

## 💡 How It Works

![workflow](../assets/workflow.svg)

Celer generates a platform-specific `toolchain_file.cmake` that bridges your project to pre-configured build environments and dependencies. This keeps Celer completely decoupled from your project - once the toolchain file is generated, you can share it with your team and they don't even need Celer installed!

## 🌟 Key Features

| Feature | What You Get |
| --- | --- |
| **🔧 Configurable Cross-Compilation Platforms** | Pre-define toolchains for ARM, x86, RISC-V, Windows, Linux, and more with friendly TOML configurations. |
| **🎮 Embedded System Support** | First-class support for MCU and bare-metal environments with `embedded_system` flag - no OS dependencies required. |
| **📁 Project-Level Dependency Management** | Each project maintains its own dependency versions, environment variables, macros, and CMake variables - preventing global conflicts. |
| **🛠️ Multi-Build System Support** | Native support for **CMake**, **Makefiles**, **Meson**, **B2**, **QMake**, **GYP** - no need to write complex scripts. |
| **📦 Auto CMake Config Generation** | Prebuilt libraries automatically get CMake config files generated, ensuring seamless integration. |
| **⚡ Intelligent Package Caching** | Hash-based artifact caching via local network shares eliminates redundant builds. Supports pre-built package distribution for private libraries. |
| **💻 Developer Mode** | Generate `toolchain_file.cmake` once with `celer deploy`, then use any IDE for development. |
| **🔄 CI/CD Integration** | Configure projects in `conf/projects` for seamless continuous integration pipelines. |
| 📸 **Workspace Snapshot** | A reproducible workspace snapshot makes it easy to fix bugs and add features. |


## 🆚 Celer vs Others

Celer has solved critical pain points that traditional C/C++ package managers struggle with:

| Challenge | Conan / Vcpkg / XMake | ✅ Celer |
|-----------|----------------------|---------|
| **📦 Simplified Library Integration** | Complex recipe scripts required | Just declare the build system type |
| **🏢 Project-Level Dependency Isolation** | Global configs cause conflicts | Project-level isolated configurations |
| **🔗 Platform Multi-Project Management** | Manual per-project setup | Single TOML, auto-sync sub-projects |
| **⚡ Intelligent Hash-Based Caching** | Limited or manual caching | Precision hash-based artifact caching |
| **🔍 Automatic Conflict Detection** | Runtime discovery | Build-time checks and reporting |
| **🤝 Seamless Cross-Company Collaboration** | Manual environment setup | Portable toolchain file - works out of the box |
